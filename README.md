## Conclusion

#### **Conclusion for the Year 2019**

- **Sales Decline**: Overall sales decreased by more than 10% compared to the previous year.
- **Product Performance**: All of the top 7 products experienced a decline in sales, contributing to the overall decrease.
- **Customer Impact**: A drop in sales is notably driven by just 4 key customers.
- **Profit Margins**: Despite the sales decline, the profit margin in the Export channel remains higher than in other channels.
- **Logistics Efficiency**: The average order delay has increased, indicating potential inefficiencies in the logistics process.
- **Warehouse Utilization**: Warehouse 4 is being overutilized, which may be contributing to the higher average order delay and overall logistics challenges.
